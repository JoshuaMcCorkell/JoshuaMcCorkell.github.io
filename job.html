                <h3>What Makes this Position Appealing</h3>
                <p class="left">The position for a web developer who can actively maintain and improve the webpage, while also doubling as an IT assistant within the company, maintaining and troubleshooting the company’s technology infrastructure, servers, databases etc.
                This position is appealing to me because:</p>
                <p class="left">Firstly, it is for Creation Ministries International, a company whose work I have passionately supported and followed for some years.</p>
                <p class="left">Secondly, the work is in an area I am interested in: programming (web-development) and IT. Web-Development is not something that I have done a lot of in the past, but it is something I am willing to learn more about, because it is not only needed for this job, but it is a very in-demand skill in the current workplace.</p>
