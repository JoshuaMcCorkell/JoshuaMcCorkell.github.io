                <p class="left">This job advertisement was sent in an email some time ago, as I am on the mailing list of the company. The screenshots are from the email, and the link is the more recent, online version of the advertisement (for either the same or a similar position).</p>

                <h3>What Makes this Position Appealing</h3>
                <p class="left">The position for a web developer who can actively maintain and improve the webpage, while also doubling as an IT assistant within the company, maintaining and troubleshooting the company’s technology infrastructure, servers, databases etc.
                This position is appealing to me because:</p>
                <p class="left">Firstly, it is for Creation Ministries International, a company whose work I have passionately supported and followed for some years.</p>
                <p class="left">Secondly, the work is in an area I am interested in: programming (web-development) and IT. Web-Development is not something that I have done a lot of in the past, but it is something I am willing to learn more about, because it is not only needed for this job, but it is a very in-demand skill in the current workplace.</p>
                <h3>Skills and Qualifications Required for this Job</h3>
                <p class="left">The skills required for this job are, very generally, the skills of a Full-Stack Web Developer, combined with some IT maintenance and troubleshooting skills. The specific skills they mentioned in the email advertisement were:
                    <ul class="left">
                        <li>Vue.js, Bootstrap and TailwindCSS for front-end development of their website</li>
                        <li>PHP, Node.js, PrestaShop and Joomla for the back-end development</li>
                        <li>Experience with Web servers (Linux) and SQL databases</li>
                        <li>Git and Docker for project management</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of Windows Server and Microsoft Office</li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 
                <p class="left">In addition, skills such as software project management, routing, and IT troubleshooting skills were mentioned. The last thing the advertisement mentioned was good people skills (The Other Qualities section). One interesting thing that was said is that not every single one of these skills are required, as long as you are confident and able to learn the needed skills while on the job.</p>
                <h3>Skills and Qualifications I Currently Have</h3>
                <p class="left">I don’t have many of the skills required for this job. I have some limited experience with Git version control, and also fair experience using Microsoft Office. I have also used SQL a couple of times before. As to web development, I have very little skill and experience in that regard, and I have never used any of the specific tools they mentioned. I have some limited experience using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. In addition, I have some experience with programming and programming principles. Overall, I have some very basic IT and programming skills, but a long way to go for most of the skills mentioned in the job advertisement.</p>
                <h3>How I will Obtain the Skills and Qualifications Needed for this Job</h3>
                <p class="left">Completing the Bachelor of IT at RMIT will be the first step to gaining the skills required for this job. From looking at the courses taught in the degree, this will fulfill some of the requirements, such as some web-development skills, Software project management, Database and SQL skills, and experience with IT infrastructure and concepts. The other skills listed can be gained by one, or a combination of other means such as:
                    <ul class="left">
                        <li>Self-Study</li>
                        <li>Work or other IT experience</li>
                        <li>An internship or similar arrangement</li>
                        <li>Further study</li>
                        <li>On-the-job learning, as mentioned in the advertisement</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="left">As to the other qualities mentioned in the advertisement, I think some of these may be bit of a weak point of mine. I can work to improve my skills in the area as I gain more experience in IT and (more importantly) as I gain more life experience in general. </p>
