                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p class="left">
                    My IT project idea is for a program that actively coaches and educates you when you are coding. It will integrate with popular code editors like VS Code. While you are writing code, it will watch what you are writing, 
                    and quickly alert you to the presence of bugs, stylistic mistakes, syntax errors, and any other kinds of problems that it can find. This program will tell you exactly where the mistake is, why it is a problem, and how to fix it, 
                    in addition to doing all the other jobs of a standard code linter or static code analyser. Additionally, it will also include tutorials to help you start off quickly with a programming language. 
                    Ideally, this program will also include the ability to ask questions about how to do certain things (for example), a bit like a google search for ‘how do I do xyz in abc language’. The name of the of the project is CodeCoach.

                <p class="left">
                    CodeCoach is a program that coaches and teaches people when they code. It will integrate into code editors like VS Code as an extension. It will have 4 main functionalities: 
                    <strong>Linting, Tutorials, How-to,</strong> and <strong>Debugging</strong>. It will also have a <strong>Glossary</strong> for programming terms and jargon. In the examples, words in blue would be in the glossary.

                    <h4>Linting</h4>
                    <p class="left">
                        The CodeCoach Linting functionality will include all the things that normal linting and code analysis tools include: identifying possible bugs and mistakes, pointing out stylistic mistakes/improvements, 
                        and alerting the programmer to different code smells that may have overlooked. In addition, CodeCoach will have information readily available about these problems, and show the user why these things are a problem, 
                        and how to fix them, all in an easy-to-understand, beginner friendly way. It will also have different levels and settings available. For example, the user could set certain types of bugs to high importance, 
                        so that CodeCoach will have a popup-box when they occur (See example: hover for before and after), or they could set it to low importance (just an underline maybe) or even off if they don’t want to be bothered with that type of problem. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Tutorials</h4>
                    <p class="left">
                        CodeCoach will have numerous tutorials available to help people learn programming languages and programming concepts. These will be especially useful for people wanting to use a certain language for the first time (See example).
                        It can step them through the process of setting up their first program, the syntax of the language, and how to use common code constructs in that language. There could also be tutorials about common programming ideas, 
                        such as how to connect to a database, how to read data from files on your computer, how to connect to internet APIs, etc.

                <h4>How-To</h4>
                <p class="left">
                    The how-to feature of CodeCoach is very similar to the tutorials feature, but contains more numerous, shorter instructional articles/tutorials that the user can search for. Things like ‘How to check if string can be interpreted as float in python’, 
                    ‘How to clone a struct in Rust’, and ‘How to add a border to a container in CSS’. This feature could be very useful for all types of programmers, and potentially save large amounts of time that they would have used searching through Google 
                    and Stack Overflow for the answer. CodeCoach would also have the ability to show and use the official documentation of the language, which would be a very convenient thing to have in your code editor.
                </p>
                <h4>Debugging</h4>
                <p class="left">
                    The debug feature of CodeCoach would run at the same time as normal debug features in languages (such as breakpoints and possibly code step-through). This is one part of the project I am a little unsure about, but ideally it would be able to make 
                    suggestions to you based on certain inputs from the user and knowledge about the program and purpose, all integrated with the other features such as the glossary, linter, and how-to. For example, if at a certain breakpoint a variable was set to 5, 
                    but you told the program it was supposed to be set to 2, it could try to work out where it was being set incorrectly / where the logic error is.
                </p>
                <h4>Glossary</h4>
                <p class="left">
                    The glossary feature is similar to the How-To feature, and has explanations and definitions of programming and IT terminology and jargon. Many words in the other sections of the program will be linked to a glossary entry so users can 
                    easily understand any words or concepts they are unsure of. (As I mentioned above, in the examples, the words in blue would be in the glossary).
                </p>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p class="left">
                    If this project were successful, it would have the potential to be an important and very useful tool for programming and coding education and learning. I have never seen any tools or programs before that were able to teach programming 
                    from inside a Code Editor. I believe this project could fill this ‘niche’, and if executed well, could become a very popular and easy way to learn to code, in addition to doing (at least in part) the jobs of sites like Stack Overflow, 
                    and saving programmers time when they need to search for something or check the official documentation.
