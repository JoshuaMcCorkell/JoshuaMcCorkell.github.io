                        I am a 16-year-old student from Hervey Bay, Queensland. I have been home-schooled for almost 5 years, and I’m currently transitioning from home-schooling to university studies. My goal currently is, in the coming 2-3 years, to complete the Bachelor of IT through RMIT online. I was born in Brisbane, and I currently live with my family at CYC Pialba, which we are the managers of. I am also a Christian.

                        In addition to English, I have learnt German for a number of years, and I’m also learning Chinese. My education up to this point: Grades 1-7 at a regular day-school, ~4 ½ years home-schooling, and I have also completed 2 University subjects through OUA: Academic and Professional Communications (Curtin), and Fundamentals of Mathematics (Murdoch). Interesting fact about myself: I love playing chess, and regularly compete in local and state competitions. There is a surprisingly large chess community around Queensland, including many talented young players (whom I get regularly beaten by!).
