                <h3>What These Test Results Mean for Me</h3>
                <p class="left">
                    The results of these tests are an interesting insight into some things that may be true about myself. I also recognize, however, that they are just generated by algorithms, and in reality don’t carry a lot of weight compared with real life insights (from people who know me, for example). 
                    I actually related very well with a lot of the things that were said in the Myer-Briggs test. For example, it said that Architects are usually very well informed about their views, and base their opinions of research and evidence, which gives them ‘the conviction that they need to stand up for their ideas, even in the face of disagreement’. 
                    I can see that this is very true of myself. It also says they are somewhat cynical and sceptical, sometimes blind to other people’s emotions, but also ambitious; all of which I can definitely relate with. The learning style test put me as a visual learner. I am of the opinion, however, that people learn best with a combination of ‘styles’, not just any single style 
                    (as per <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA&ab_channel=Veritasium" target="_blank">this video</a>). That being said, learning visually does come fairly naturally to me. As for the big five personality test, it was a bit vaguer than the Myer-Briggs test, but I could still relate with some of the things it said (although overall I found it slightly less relatable/accurate than the Myer-Briggs test).

                <h3>How Could These Results Influence my Behaviour in a Team</h3>
                <p class="left">
                    I think when working in a team I will have to keep in mind some things about myself. For example, I often get frustrated when other people are not doing a job as well as I could have done it (or I thought I could have done it), and I can sometimes get caught up trying to defend my opinion/position on a matter when it really is not as important as it seems. 
                    In addition, I often gravitate towards debating with someone who doesn’t agree with me, when sometimes it would be better in that situation to just let the differences slide. When I am in a team, I will need to keep these things in mind, to make sure that I can not only be a good member of the team, but work well with the others in the team, even though I often prefer to work by myself.

                <h3>How Should I Take This Into Account When Forming a Team</h3>
                <p class="left">
                    When I’m forming a team, I will try to join a team with people who are active in the course, and that I think can work well with. In addition, and more importantly, I will take these things into account by making sure I accept the other team members and do my best to work with them and get along well with them, even if sometimes it can be annoying if they do things or want to do things in a way 
                    I wouldn’t normally, work slower than I would have wanted them to do, have opinions that differ with my own, etc. And I will try to prioritize the team workflow and synergy over other things like those that may cloud my judgement.
